# @scoped-observer/react-state-machine

A lightweight, fully typed, and flexible state machine implementation for React applications.  
This package enables clean and predictable state transitions with a simple API, seamlessly integrated with React hooks and render props.

It is designed to work well for common UI patterns such as modals, drawers, wizards, tabs, and more â€” anywhere you need controlled state management with clear transitions.  
Thanks to its generic design and TypeScript support, it ensures type safety and excellent developer experience.

## Example Usage

```tsx
import React from "react";
import {
  createMachine,
  useMachine,
} from "@scoped-observer/react-state-machine";

const SomeMachine = createMachine({
  init: "open",
  transition: {
    close: {
      on: {
        TOGGLE: "open",
      },
    },
    open: {
      on: {
        TOGGLE: "close",
      },
    },
  },
});

const SomeComponent = () => {
  const { state, payload } = useMachine(SomeMachine);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Current State: {state}</h1>
      <p>Payload: {payload ?? "-"}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

const HomePage = () => {
  const { send } = useMachine(SomeMachine);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home Page</h1>
      <button
        onClick={() =>
          send({
            type: "TOGGLE",
            payload: 111,
          })
        }
      >
        Toggle from HomePage
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <HomePage />
      <SomeComponent />
    </>
